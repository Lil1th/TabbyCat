# Tabby Cat Hacks
The best Tabby Cat hacks on the internet! Save yourself $10, a bunch of reloads, and get some hacker-exclusive bonuses too. I hope you enjoy my hacks for Tabby Cat, and remember to look at the code and learn! ^^

Here's what everything does:

## Chomusuke
This is the original permanent pets hack, it is an unpacked extension using the improved format that bypasses Google Payments to get you pets for free. Named after Megumin's cat from KonoSuba.
*Chomusuke will be updated as events warrant*

## Chomusuke Legendary
See above, but with legendary cats on every reload instead of only ~8% of the time.
*Chomusuke Legendary will be updated as events warrant*

## Doki Doki Chomusuke Club
A PoC for setting custom background images. Great for the most superior of people, i.e. DDLC fans.
*DDCC will NOT be updated for future versions, as it was a joke*

## Elizabeth III
This could be considered an installer tool for Chomusuke. Originally it would simply replace files with other files, but it now modifies the core JS itself. Named after Jumin's cat from Mystic Messenger.
*Elizabeth III will be updated as events warrant*

## Ferris
Custom fonts. Pretty straightforward. Named after best girl from Re:Zero. Fight me.
*Ferris will be updated on the off chance it ever needs an update. I doubt this will be the case.*

## FileNotFound and FileNotFound (Swift)
These are fixes for TheSwiftPhantom's Chomusuke mod FileNotFound. Mostly created to help show Swift where her mistakes were, so she can keep improving ^^
*FileNotFound will not be updated by me, but might by TheSwiftPhantom*

## Ichigo
Swap between the various Tabby Cat mods made by TheSwiftPhantom and me. Named after Momomiya Ichigo, the protagonist of Tokyo Mew Mew. Don't judge me, I watched it when I was like 12.
*Ichigo will be updated as events warrant*

## Kaguya
Change almost every colour in Tabby Cat to be whatever you want! This was one of the most difficult to make so I hope you like it. Named after Shinomiya Kaguya from Love is War. Because of that one cat ears scene.
*Kaguya will be ipdated on the off chance it ever needs an update. It will if Ferris does, but it's unlikely.*

## Komi
Custom background images. The fulfillment of DDCC. Named after Komi-san from Komi Can't Communicate.
*Same as Ferris and Kaguya*

## Tabby Cat Goodies
All the goodies in Tabby Cat, to be copy/pasted into Inspect.
*Will be updated every time, although it's likely someone else will get to it before me since this is an easy hack*

## Tabby Cat Pets
All the pets in Tabby Cat, to be copy/pasted into Inspect. Required to use Chomusuke and related mods.
**Will be updated every time, and this one is more likely to be done by me than the goodies, but still easy hack*
